# To-Do-List
This repository contains code for a "Basic Todo List". This was made when I learned how to code in Angular2. It will contain a new application that was created using the angular cli tool. This project will demonstrate my mastery of using the four basic CRUD operations.

This project was created using the Angular CLI tool version 8.2.0.

npm install command will be needed to install the node_modules folder.

This project will allow users to create and manage tasks using the four basic CRUD operations, Create, Read, Update, Delete.
    A user should be able to create tasks
    A user should be able to view a list of tasks by their name.

A user should be able to click on an individual task.
    When a task is selected, a detailed view about the task should be displayed.
        Should be displayed in the browser with the URL of /:taskid
        The details should include:
            Time to complete
            Description
            Necessary items needed to complete the task

A user should be able to update a specific task on the list of tasks page AND on the detailed view page.

This project will have a JSON file at the root of the project to store the tasks. This will enable me to use HTTP
    verbs to perfom CRUD operations.
